# tiny-lemon
static library written in C programming language

represents a virtual imagined computer
* 256 bytes of RAM
* 256 bytes of Stack
* 8 registers (8 bits each)
* 9 address modes
* 132 operations
* 223 instructions
* von neumann architecture

## why?

education - not the best for it, but you can study how processor works,
how to implement features wich no implemented by default,
how assembly languages works and how to create your own language.

challenges - what do you think you can implement in 256 bytes of RAM?
hello world? cat program? 99 bottles of beer on the wall? calculator?
snake? tetris? pac-man? doom? skyrim? minecraft? OS? compiler? VM?

fun - have a good time doing some tricks and experiments.
